# Drug Conversion Matching Game

This repository hosts a single-page, offline-capable matching-pairs game for student nurses to practice unit conversions.

## Quick start (GitHub Pages)

1. **Upload files** to your repo (root folder): 
   - `index.html` (the game file)
2. Go to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, set:
   - **Source:** Deploy from branch
   - **Branch:** `main` (root `/`)
4. Save. Wait ~1–2 minutes, then open the site URL shown by GitHub Pages.

## Editing pairs in the game

- Click **✏️ Editor** and enter pairs in this format (one per line):  
  `0.125 g = 125 mg`
- Click **Save**. Changes are saved to your browser's storage on that device.

## Tips

- Click **New Game** to reshuffle.
- Click **Reveal All** to show cards for teaching moments.
- The numbers that identify pairs are **hidden** in this build (students only see "Order" and "Conversion").
